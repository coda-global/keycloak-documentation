==== reCAPTCHA Support

To safeguard registration against bots, {project_name} has integration with Google reCAPTCHA.
To enable this you need to first go to link:https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/[Google Recaptcha Website]
and create an API key so that you can get your reCAPTCHA site key and secret.
(FYI, localhost does not work by default so you need to add in 'Domains').

Choosing the type of reCAPTCHA

There are mainly two types of reCAPTCHA. 

`reCAPTCHA v3` (Preferred)

reCAPTCHA v3 allows you to verify if an interaction is legitimate without any user interaction. It is a pure JavaScript API returning a score, giving you the ability to take action in the context of your site: for instance requiring additional factors of authentication, sending a post to moderation, or throttling bots that may be scraping content.
v3 requires `Site Key` & `Secret Key`. Optinally, you can configure `Site Score` & `Site Action Name`. 

For more information: https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3[reCAPTCHA v3 Docs]

`reCAPTCHA v2 ("I'm not a robot" Checkbox)`

The "I'm not a robot" Checkbox requires the user to click a checkbox indicating the user is not a robot. This will either pass the user immediately (with No CAPTCHA) or challenge them to validate whether or not they are human. This is the simplest option to integrate with and only requires two lines of HTML to render the checkbox.
v2 requires `Site Key` & `Secret Key`.

Next, there are a few steps you need to perform in the {project_name} Admin Console.
Click the `Authentication` left menu item and go to the `Flows` tab.  Select the `Registration` flow from the drop down
list on this page.

Set the 'reCAPTCHA' requirement to `Required` by clicking the appropriate radio button. Click on the 'Actions' button that is to the right of the reCAPTCHA flow entry, then "Config" link. This will enable
reCAPTCHA config on the screen.  Next, Select your reCAPTCHA version from the dropdown `reCAPTCHA Version` and then you have to enter in the reCAPTCHA site key and secret that you generated at the https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/[Google reCAPTCHA Admin console]. If you are using v3, you can update `reCAPTCHA Score` & `reCAPTCHA Action`.

The final step you have to do is to change some default HTTP response headers that {project_name} sets.  {project_name}
will prevent a website from including any login page within an iframe.  This is to prevent clickjacking attacks.  You need to
authorize Google to use the registration page within an iframe.  Go to
the `Realm Settings` left menu item and then go to the `Security Defenses` tab.  You will need to add `\https://www.google.com` to the
values of both the `X-Frame-Options` and `Content-Security-Policy` headers.

Once you do this, reCAPTCHA should show up on your registration page.  You may want to edit _register.ftl_ in your login
theme to muck around with the placement and styling of the reCAPTCHA button.  See the link:{developerguide_link}[{developerguide_name}]
for more information on extending and creating themes.
